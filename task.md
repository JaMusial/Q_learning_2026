I want to create table with data to my research paper. Read generacja_wykresow_papier.m and 
rys_wyk_papier_reduced.m. I want to expand reduced script to also generate 
tables similar to to first script. It should make matlab and latex table like this:


|		                      |       T0=0.5		|	     T0=2	      |         T0=4		|
|	  T0 compensation         |	Full | Over | Under | Full | Over |	Under | Full | Over | Under |
|	        |IAE			  |						
|SP change	|Max u			  |						
|	        |Max overshoot	  |								
|	        |IAE			  |						
|d=-0.3	    |Max u			  |						
|	        |Max overshoot	  |								


I wont be showing evolution of parameters with epochs of learning only final value from last experiment
with 3000 epochs of leanirning. Dont mess with plot generetion i only want to add tables genaration.
Plan your work first, ask me questuions if needed then alter the code in rys_wyk_papier_reduced.m.
